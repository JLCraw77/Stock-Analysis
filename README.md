# VBA - Challenge - Refactoring Code
## Overview and Purpose of the analysis
### Overview - Modify existing code to be more efficient for our client to process many years of data.
### Purpose - Refactoring the Analysis allowed the computing process to be accelerated.  The code was more efficient way to process many lines of data provided
---
### Results - The code was successful in working with both 2018 and 2017 data in providing the information our client was looking for in a short time.
- Providing the pop-up to input the year desired allowed for many different years of data to process using the same VBA code.

- Displaying the tabled information for all of the tickers in a concise summary of the data for a quick overview and analysis of the information.

### Summary:
#### Code in General
- Advantages to Refactoring code:  Utlizing a "first draft" of a similar code can make the coding process quicker allowing for improving the code to perform better and more efficient than the original version of the code.
- Disadvantage in using refactored code is that it can be harder to trouble shoot as you go through the code depending on the number of changes required.  

#### Code in VBS Script
- Advantage is the code syntax can be re-used for the majority of the code changes without having to figure out the arguments for each line or conditional statement, thus speeding up the coding process.
- Disavantage of using existing code is in the trouble shooting of the code.  This may take longer than normal if starting from scratch.  Depending on the similarities of the processes where you are trying to use refactored code, it may be quicker in some instances to just re-write from new if there are enough differences.  this would keep the format of the code more clean and clear.
